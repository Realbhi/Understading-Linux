### Linux Distributions: Variants and Their Roles
---

Linux distributions (distros) are customized versions of the Linux OS, created by various organizations or communities by adding features, tools, and wrappers on top of the Linux kernel. Popular examples include:
```bash
- Ubuntu (developed by Canonical)
- Red Hat
- Fedora
- Debian
- Alpine
```
 
Each distribution shares a common core but differentiates itself through:
```bash
- Additional system packages and utilities.
- User interface customizations.
- Specialized tools aimed at specific use cases.
```
